Website Feedback module requires html2canvas library. By default, it uses the library from CDN. But you can install it locally.

To use local Html2canvas library:

1. Download it from https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas.
2. Place it into libraries folder, so that there's a
   libraries/html2canvas/html2canvas.min.js file, in addition to the other
   files included in the library.
3. In the module's configuration page uncheck 'Load Html2canvas library from CDN' option
